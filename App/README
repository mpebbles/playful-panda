General idea right now is to store content in JSON files.
Only relevant JSON files will be downloaded to app.

Have home page have list of Lessons (initial store data)
on click -> action to retrieve lesson info from selected json file
navigate to display page for lesson, load JSON data

unit tests!

Won't be adding, just opening. Redux code there as
placeholder for now -- will be used for opening JSON
files.
