PLEASE NOTE: The infrastructure for the app is still
being developed, so the existing code is nonsensical.

TODO: way of putting files on phone
TODO: upon loading app, get list of files starting
      with LESSON_ to display, when loaded use
      action and send to reducer
TODO: Upon clicking a file name, navigate to display
      page and load data using actions/reducer
TODO: cleanup/format

General idea right now is to store content in JSON files.
Only relevant JSON files will be downloaded to app.

Have home page have list of Lessons (initial store data)
on click -> action to retrieve lesson info from selected json file
navigate to display page for lesson, load JSON data

unit tests!

NOTE: In the future I would like to use external
storage with react-native-fs for android
