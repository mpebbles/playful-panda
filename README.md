## Overview
Please note that this is a work-in-progress =)
### Purpose
The goal of this project is to further spread the gospel, and to act as a
catalyst for the equipping and empowering of humans outside of the first-world
bubble.
### How?
Creation of devices containing information, an educational tool, and a
medium of creation, all in an understood language, and then the deployment of
these devices to people whom do not have access to an electrical grid,
nor to internet.  
## Components
### Hardware
- inexpensive Android devices (or donated Android device/iPhone)
- SD cards for higher storage capacity (more information)
- solar powered chargers/battery packs

Estimated cost: less than $50 per unit
### Software
#### Information
Using the on-device file-systems to save information, either through
offline-tabs saved or offline-versions of apps pre-loaded with information.

Type of information needed can be recommended from organizations with more
expertise in this area. My initial thoughts are for

Bible app pre-loaded.

Any apps with offline utility also pre-loaded.
#### Lessons/Try-it-yourself
Since computers are programmable, an app can be developed which allows the user
to learn and test their comprehension without a teacher, for areas where
teachers are few-and-far between.
#### General Creation Mechanisms
- Use of the existing notes app on the phone.
- A painting/drawing app?
- An app in which code can be interpreted in order to practice problem/solving
  and provide a medium for idea-implementation.
#### Software High-Level Implementation Plan
As of now I plan on implementing the lessons/try-it-yourself and code
interpreter in a React-Native app, so that this project can be cross-platform.
I intend for lesson/quiz development to be accessible to non-programmers so that
a wide-array of content from various disciplines can be easily developed by
people interested in helping.
## Deployment Options
### All-in-One Package
- Contains instructions and greeting written in native language,
  backup-batteries, solar charger.
### Central Charging Variation
- Same as above, but with a central repository of batteries/battery-packs and
  a large solar powered charging system.
## Roles
### Developers
### Content Developers
### Someone with knowledge of how to keep us from getting sued
### Hardware Designer
### Business Contact Person
  - find organizations to partner with and get donations
    (monetary or old phones/components)
### UX (user experience)

## Additional Notes
Phones would be set up to include the necessary information (in the right
language, and information relevant to the context in which the recipients
reside) before deployment, where there is power and access to internet.
For this project I originally intended to use raspberry-pis with peripherals,
but have since opted for cellular devices since they are inexpensive, plentiful,
have little-to-no design overhead, have language-translation abilities, and the
components of the device are nicely-contained. I also find cellular devices to
be more versatile for this project because of existing apps/easy management.
